TodoList app
============


Presentation
------------

This app allowed me to start on several technologies :
* Scala
* Play2
* Coffee Script
* AngularJS

It is based on todo tutorial from angularjs web site on
which i have added a play2/scala backend

Beside, all angular code is wrapped in requirejs amd modules
and written with coffee script

Objectives
----------

First aim was to learn technologies described up there
But, while programming i realized that organizing angularjs code into
requirejs modules with coffee script layer is not really obvious.
Same goes for some scala code.

So this app acts also as a reminder, at least for me, at best for others developers :)

As i said before, this is my first attempt on several new technologies here, so feel free to
send me any pull requests or open issues if you see some awfull things :) 

On otherside, if this is helpful let me know too.


TODO
----
- Provide tests for both backend and frontend
- Handle undone action
- Archive view to add some angular code
